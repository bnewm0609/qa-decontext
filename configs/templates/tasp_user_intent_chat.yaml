      The following "text snippet" will be quoted in an article using the Chicago Manual of Style. Using the given information from scientific paper, rewrite the "text snippet" into quote format by adding in any clarifying information in square brackets. The information should answer the questions below.

      Information from the paper:

      Title: "{{title}}"

      Abstract: "{{abstract}}"
      {% if context_section_header %}
      Header of section with the snippet: "{{context_section_header}}"
      {% endif %}
      Paragraph with the snippet: "{{context_paragraph}}"

      Text snippet: "{{snippet_rewrite}}"

      Instructions:

      Using the given information, rewrite the text snippet into quote format. Specifically, add clarifying information that answers the following questions based only on the given information from the paper:

      Questions:
      {% for question in questions %}* {{question['question']}}
      {% endfor %}
      Add the clarifying information between square brackets.
      For example: the snippet "Our approach performs well" becomes "[REF0's] approach [bidirectional language modeling] performs well".
      For example: the snippet "Our task is MT" becomes "[REF0's] task is MT [machine translation]."
      Note, like in these examples, most questions will ask to clarify vague terms (like "our approach" or "our method") or will ask for definitions of terms and acronyms (like "MT").

      After adding clarifying information:
      * Replace first-person pronouns with a placeholder. Replace "we" with "[REF0]"and "our" with "[REF0's]". The words "we" and "our" should not appear in the rewritten snippet.
      * Remove discourse markers (like "in conclusion", "in this section", "for instance", etc.)
      * Citations are marked as BIBREF or (Author Name, Year). Keep these the same. Do not add any additional citations.
      * Remove any references to Figures ("FIGREF") and Tables ("TABREF")
      * Fix the grammar

      Reminders:
      * Follow the Chicago Manual of Style for quotes by putting all added text between square brackets.
      * The rewritten snippet is a quote, so the word order should closely match the original snippet's.

      Please rewrite this snippet according to the instructions and the given information.
