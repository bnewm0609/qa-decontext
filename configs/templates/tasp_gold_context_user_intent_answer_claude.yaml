  {% if evidence["section"] and evidence["section"] != "Abstract" %}Section Header: "{{ evidence["section"] }}"{% endif %}
  {% if evidence.get("section", "") != "Abstract" %}Paragraph: "{{evidence["paragraph"]}}"{% endif %}
  {% endfor %}{% if context_section_header %}
  Header of section with the snippet: "{{context_section_header}}"
  {% endif %}
  Paragraph with the snippet: "{{context_paragraph}}"

  Instructions:

  Using the given information, rewrite the text snippet into quote format. Specifically, add clarifying information based only on the answers the following questions and the given information from the paper.

  For example: the snippet "Our task is MT" becomes "[REF0's] task is MT [machine translation]."

  After adding clarifying information:
  * Replace first-person pronouns with a placeholder. Replace "we" with "[REF0]" and "our" with "[REF0's]".
  * Remove discourse markers (like "in conclusion", "in this section", "for instance", etc.)
  * Citations are marked as BIBREF or (Author Name, Year). Keep these the same. Do not add any additional citations.
  * Remove any references to Figures ("FIGREF") and Tables ("TABREF")
  * Fix the grammar

  * Follow the Chicago Manual of Style for quotes by putting all added text between square brackets.
  * The rewritten snippet is a quote, so the word order should closely match the original snippet's.
